# Embedded-Power-Supply
Common voltages for embedded projects

Circuit Board that converts input voltage to common direct current voltages used in embeed projects: 5.0V, 3.3V, and 1.8V from an input of up to 32.0V DC.

Intention is to get designs into KiKad from which various supply voltage circuits can be copied into embedded projects as needed.
